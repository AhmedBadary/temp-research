* In general, if images are captured by different equipment or in different settings:  you could use histogram equalization, which would adjust the brightness of all images to the same level, or you could use a normalization technique such as batch normalization or feature standardization, which would adjust the color and contrast of all images.

## Image Localization
{: #content1}

1. **Image Localization:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}{: .bodyContents1 #bodyContents11}  
    :   __Localization__ is the task of finding a single object in an image.  
    :   ![img](/main_files/cs231n/11_2/1.png){: width="25%"}  

2. **Image Classification+Localization:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}{: .bodyContents1 #bodyContents12}  
    :   __Localization__ can be combined with classification to, not only find the location of an object but, also, to classify it into one of different classes. 
    :   ![img](/main_files/cs231n/11_2/2.png){: width="35%"}  

3. **Structure:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}{: .bodyContents1 #bodyContents13}  
    :   * __Input__: Image  
        * __Output__: A vector of 4 coordinates of the bounding box.  

4. **Applications:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}{: .bodyContents1 #bodyContents14}  
    :   * Smart Cropping
        * Regular Object Extraction (as a pre-processing step)  
        * Human Pose Estimation: Represent pose as a set of 14 joint positions

## Approaches
{: #content2}

1. **Localization as a Regression Problem:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}{: .bodyContents2 #bodyContents21}  
    :   Since we are concerned with returning real-valued numbers (the bounding box coordinates), we use a method that is suitable for the task, __Regression__.   
    :   ![img](/main_files/cs231n/11_2/3.png){: width="80%"}
    :   * __Algorithm__:    
            * Use any classification architecture  
            * Attach two _Fully Connected Layers_, one for __Classification__ and one for __Localization__  
            * Backpropagate through the whole network using _cross-entropy loss_ and _L2 loss_ respectively.  
    :   * __Evaluation Metric:__ Intersection over Union.
