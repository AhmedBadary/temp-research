2. **(mostly) Solved Problems in NLP:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}{: .bodyContents1 #bodyContents12} 
    :   * Spam Detection  
        * Parts-of-Speech (POS) Tagging  
        * Named Entity Recognition (NER)  


3. **Within-Reach Problems:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}{: .bodyContents1 #bodyContents13} 
    :   * Sentiment Analysis  
        * Coreference Resolution    
        * Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)  
        * Parsing  
        * Machine Translation (MT)  
        * Information Extraction (IE)    


4. **Open Problems in NLP:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}{: .bodyContents1 #bodyContents14} 
    :   * Question Answering (QA)   
        * Paraphrasing  
        * Summarization  
        * Dialog  

5. **Issues in NLP (why nlp is hard?):**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}{: .bodyContents1 #bodyContents15} 
    :   * __Non-Standard English__: "Great Job @ahmed_badary! I luv u 2!! were SOO PROUD of dis."  
        * __Segmentation Issues__: "New York-New Haven" vs "New-York New-Haven"  
        * __Idioms__: "dark horse", "getting cold feet", "losing face"  
        * __Neologisms__: "unfriend", "retweet", "google", "bromance"  
        * __World Knowledge__: "Ahmed and Zach are brothers", "Ahmed and Zach are fathers"    
        * __Tricky Entity Names__: "Where is _Life of Pie_ playing tonight?", "_Let it be_ was a hit song!"  

6. **Tools we need for NLP:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}{: .bodyContents1 #bodyContents16} 
    :   * Knowledge about Language.  
        * Knowledge about the World.   
        * A way to combine knowledge sources.  

7. **Methods:**{: style="color: SteelBlue"}{: .bodyContents1 #bodyContents17} 
    :   In general we need to construct __Probabilistic Models__ built from _language data_.    
    :   We do so by using _rough text features_.  
        > All the concepts, models, methods, and tools mentioned above will be introduced later as you progress in the text.
